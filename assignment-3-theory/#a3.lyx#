\begin_layout Section
Minimum Spanning vs Shortest Path Tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path problem produces a Shortest Path
 Tree.
 Compare the Shortest Path Tree to the Minimum Weight Spanning Tree on the
 graph below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename mst spt.svg
	width 90text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting Miniumum Weight Spanning Tree has 
\begin_inset Formula $weight=32$
\end_inset

, while the resulting Shortest Path Tree has 
\begin_inset Formula $weight=36$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the Shortest Path Tree produced by Dijkstra's Since Source Path
 problem is not necessarily the Minimum Weight Spanning Tree.

\begin_layout Section
Directed Dijkstra's Algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming a directed graph 
\begin_inset Formula $D=(V,E)$
\end_inset

 with points 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y\}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}$
\end_inset

 is the shortest path between 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are no cycles in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}$
\end_inset

, otherwise two edges may be removed from 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}$
\end_inset

 and it will result in a path with the same source and destination, but
 a lower cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since there are no cycles, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}$
\end_inset

 contains only edges 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{P}=e_{0},...,e_{i-1},e_{i}\in P_{D}$
\end_inset

 travelling in one 'direction'.
 That is, there be cannot a part of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}$
\end_inset

 which requires the algorithm backtrack, since this would result in a cycle
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\{j,k\}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\{g,h\}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any directed graph 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{a}$
\end_inset

 can be seen as a subset of the undirected graph 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because an undirected graph can be transformed into a directed
 graph with each undirected edge 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{a}$
\end_inset

 being replaced by pair of oppositely pointing directed edges 
\begin_inset Formula $\{e_{b},e_{c}\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dijkstra's Algorithm always pulls in the lowest cost edge into it's set
 that doesn't create a cycle.
 It cannot select edges from outside of the set travelling into the set,
 only outgoing edges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\{P_{0},...,P_{D},...,P_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 be the set of all shortest pathes from a source 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to the other vertexes in the graph.
 This is the Shortest Path Tree.

Application Areas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Logistics and shipping.
 Dijksta's algorithm is can be utilized by logistics companies to plan packages
 routes and optimize shipping.
 For example, if a graph where each vertex is a depot, and edges are weighted
 according to the distance and/or cost to move items to that depot from
 others, Dijkstra's can be used to find the shortest or cheapest path to
 move the item along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Geographic Information System.
 For an application like Google Maps which produces directions between points
 A and B, Dijkstra's can be used to determine the optimal path along roads
 or other methods of transit like ferries, buses, or freeways.
 In this case, edge weights do not necessarily represent the distance travelled,
 but might be weighted based on a number of factors, including traffic and
 weather warnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Network Routing.
 In order to determine the optimal route for packets within a communications
 network Dijkstra's algorithm can be used, in this case edge weights might
 be determined by the link rate between routers.
