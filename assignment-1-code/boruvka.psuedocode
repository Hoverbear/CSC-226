Input: A connected graph G.
Initialize a forest T to be a set of one-vertex trees
While T has more than one component:
  For each component C of T:
    Begin with an empty set of edges S
    For each vertex v in C:
      Find the cheapest edge(s) from v to a vertex outside of C
      If there is more than one cheapest edge:
        Choose the first in lexicographic order
      Add the edge to S
    Add the cheapest edge in S to T 
Output: T, the minimum spanning tree of G.
